# Mariáš Card Game Flowchart
Some card games are very complicated, like the national Czech game for three players "mariáš" (very similar to German Skat and Hungarian Ulti). How to explain the game to a newbie? If the newbie is a programmer, you can use a flowchart! Enjoy! (Made by me in 2016 using Gimp. This is for "volený mariáš" or Called Mariage game variant.)
